# Mindstorms EV3 Track Racer

This is software for a self-driving track racer ("folkracer") robot, written for robot built with [LEGO Mindstorms EV3](https://www.lego.com/mindstorms "LEGO Mindstorms EV3") platform, using visual programming with the LEGO Mindstorms original development environment.

Unfortunately the .ev3 file is BLOB, so i cannot really track changes with Git. However, i can still at least track revisions and versions.

My folkracer was participating in [Robotex](http://www.robotex.ee "Robotex") 2016 in Tallinn, Estonia - one of the biggest robotics events in the world, they say. Now i'm buildig an improved version for 2017.
